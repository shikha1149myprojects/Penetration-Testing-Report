# Penetration-Testing-Report

## Background and the Assignment

The Masked DJ is a worldwide phenomenon. They have quickly taken the world by storm rising to the top of the world most popular DJ lists replacing well known DJs like Carl Cox, Fatboy Slim, Diplo, and Tiesto. Playing to sellout crowds all over the world nightly The Masked DJ has gained their following by hiding behind a mask and getting club goers to return to focusing on the music.

The Masked DJ is planning to have an “unmasked” party at the start of 2020 where they will play for the first time without the mask with all proceeds from the event and associated silent auction going to charity. There is a great concern that a leak of who The Masked DJ is before the event could lead to people not showing up and the charity event being a disaster.

You and your group have been hired as a pen testing firm to see if you can break into The Masked DJ’s IT environment and discover photos of who The Masked DJ is. These photos are
stored on a development version of The Masked DJ’s website and show The Masked DJ when they were much younger. You are also to make recommendations on how The Masked DJ’s IT team should lockdown and improve their overall IT security.

The Masked DJ has a small office team who perform the office needs for The Masked DJ.
- A booking manager who books events and travel for The Masked DJ
- An IT manager who runs the IT infrastructure
- A webmaster (currently on leave) who set up the initial IT environment and runs The Masked DJ’s website. They have grant plans for a new version of the site to be launched
just after the “unmasked” party.
